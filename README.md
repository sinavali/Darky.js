# Darky.js

A simplest, one functional library wich bring you EVERY color mode you want...

this librerie is using CSS variables Sooooo there no inline styles.

just add the Darky.js to your HTML

or use the cdn:

https://helloworlds.ir/cdn/Darky.js/Darky.js

https://helloworlds.ir/cdn/Darky.js/Darky.min.js

after you insert the script just use the function below:

color_modes(select_tag_ID, default);

read the comments in the code its easier to work with it

this is just 5Kb with comments and 2 in minified

there is just a little problem and that is this baby is using a little JQUERY

and i will make it VANILLA in the next Update ...
